// Step 1 : Get count of the nodes in the first list, let count be c1.
// Step 2 : Get count of the nodes in the second list, let count be c2.
// Step 3 : Get the difference of counts d = abs(c1 â€“ c2)
// Step 4 : Now traverse the bigger list from the first node till d nodes so that from here onwards both the lists have equal no of nodes.
// Then we can traverse both the lists in parallel till we come across a common node. (Note that getting a common node is done by comparing the address of the nodes)
// Below image is a dry run of the above approach:
